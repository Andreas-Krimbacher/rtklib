1. Quick project overview.
======

RTKLIB modifications for embedded systems
based on rtklib_2.4.2b9

This project is a copy/fork of the RTKLIB project with modifications to run on embedded systems and supporting non Windows environments, 
for both console and GUI applications.  
http://www.rtklib.com/

The goal of this repository is to make contribution to the rtklib project easier. So you are welcome to participate and contributeto the project.
I will always try to merge the acutall changes of the offifcial RTKLIB, so this version should be interchangeable with the 
official one, only with additional features for other operating system, mainly Linux, and embedded devices.

3. How to get started developing
======
If you only want to **use** this project, just **fetch** files by **zip** and do whatever you want. 

For **developers** and active contributers, start with forking this repository on github. You can work on your own repository 
fecth commits from this repository. And if you think your changes could be usefull for the rest, do a pull request and 
your changes will get fetched to this repository. 


4. Code promotion workflow.
======
The prefered way, **fork** this repository, **do your work** and make a **pull request**. That's it. 

5. Environments
======
Build environments will target mostly embedded systems so they will be the standard gnu tools (make, gcc, gdb). For 
easier development eclipse is preferable, project files are also in the repository. 
For a quick start look at:
